# Welcome to AuroKit

The `@aurodesignsystem/aurokit` install package is a comprehensive npm package designed to simplify the installation and management of Auro design system components and supporting libraries. It consolidates all essential Auro packages into a single installable bundle, ensuring compatibility and reducing the complexity of dependency management for developers.

## Overview

The Auro web component ecosystem is comprised of numerous npm packages, each maintained and versioned independently. While this modular structure offers flexibility, it can be challenging for developers to manage installations and maintain consistent versions across projects. `@aurodesignsystem/aurokit` addresses these challenges by providing a streamlined solution:

- **Single Installation**: One command to install all core Auro packages.
- **Version Compatibility**: Packages included in AuroKit are pre-validated by the Auro team to ensure seamless compatibility.
- **Simplified Updates**: Use `npm update` to apply patch updates automatically.

## Features

- **Ease of Installation**: Install all core Auro components with one command.
- **Validated Versions**: Ensures that the included package versions have been vetted for compatibility.
- **Streamlined Updates**: Leverage `npm update` to keep patch updates current.
- **Scheduled Release Cycle**:
  - **Quarterly Minor Releases**: Introduces new features and improvements predictably every quarter.
  - **Annual Major Releases**: Aligns with Node.js LTS updates to maintain compatibility with current development standards.

## Installation

To install `@aurodesignsystem/aurokit`, run:

```bash
npm install @aurodesignsystem/aurokit -S
```

## Updating AuroKit

To update AuroKit and its dependencies, run:

```bash
npm update
```

This command will automatically apply compatible patch updates, as defined by npmâ€™s semver handling. Major and minor updates will be installed via SEMVER changes to AuroKit itself. 

## Roadmap

- **Quarterly Minor Updates**: Ensuring that new features and enhancements are delivered in a structured manner.
- **Annual Major Updates**: Planned in line with Node.js LTS updates to support long-term compatibility and stability.
